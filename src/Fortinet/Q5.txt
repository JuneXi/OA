we can create a MockImplement class to mock the db or use mokito framework

MockImplement
1. Create a Mock class only used in unit test. In this class we declare the variable  needed, assign some value and define the return object manually if necessary.
2. Then we need a mock spring config xml file as well, in which we declare the bean of mock class. 
3. Write the unit test, include the location of mockApplicationContext.xml. 
After that, when we run the test, it will look up in the mock config xml to call the mock class.

Mokito
1. Add the mockito dependencies to the pom.xml
2. Use mock(Class) method to create a mocked version of our Dao class. Or use @Mock and @RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class) annotations.
3. Write unit test. we can define what data to return by mockito.thenReturn() method without calling a DB.

we can create a MockImplement class to mock the db or use mokito framework

1. MockImplement
We can create a Mock class only used in unit test, as well as a mock spring config xml file.Then in the unit test class, include the mockApplicationContext.xml.
After that, when we run the test, it will look up in the mock config xml to call the mock class.

2. mokito
Firstly add the mockito dependencies to the pom.xml
Then we can use mock(Class) method to create a mocked version of our Dao class.
Here are some usedful anonotations like @RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class) , @Mock(used to declare a Dao class ), @InjectMocks
Then we can define what data to return by mockito.thenReturn() method without calling a DB.
